## APY

Algorithm for Proven and Young (APY) was created by I. Misztal (2014, 2016). This algorithm uses the fact that there is limited information in the G matrix. You only need to do the direct inverse of a subset of animals in G and then use recursion to get the rest of the inverse. This has proven to be as accurate (or more so) than the raw inverse.
